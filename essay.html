                <p><span class="lead">HTML</span> or HyperText Markup Language is the primary markup language for web pages.  It is the wireframe used to build webpages often accompanied by other technologies such as CSS (Cascade Style Sheets) and Javascript.   Hypertext:  A database format in which information related to that on a display can be accessed directly from the display; also: material (such as text) in this format. *   Markup: Refers to the sequence of characters or symbols inserted within the text often called “tags.”  This creates a good semantic structure for a webpage easily understood by the browser and the reader.  The idea of HTML has been around since 1980 but the standard HTML as we know it wasn’t until 1995 and was called HTML 2.0 intended to be treated as the standard against all future implementations should be based.   The workhorse of the internet came about in 1999 known as HTML 4.0 and is slowly being phased out as of 2014 with the introduction of HTML5.</p>
              </div>
                <p>The future of the internet is now and can be accessed in the palm of your hand, TV and even refrigerator and with this kind of accessibility the web needed to adapt to be quicker, leaner, stronger.  The biggest difference between previous versions of HTML and HTML5 is 5 supports video and audio as part of the language.  Another key difference is how clean it is, previous versions are written up as &lt;/div class=nav&gt; or &lt;/div class=main&gt; it was all done in block level “div” format.  Not to dis the div, the div and span are very important tags used to divide up your webpage however with HTML5 rather than being divided in divs it is streamlined into &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;/main&gt; &lt;/header&gt; and many more for more responsive markup.   Vector Graphics is an integral part of HTML5 such as SVG (Sizeable Vector Graphic) and Canvas, previous versions used various third party technologies to support this.  The reason the introduction of Vector type graphics is important is that It’s adaptive, you can shrink or enlarge the image without losing quality unlike bitmap.  HTML5 even offers a solution for storage by  utilizing local storage meaning web applications can store data locally with the user’s browser prior to this cookies were used and unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger and information is never transferred to the server which makes it slightly more secure.   This is made possible by using Javascript which also makes Canvas possible, canvas eliminates Adobe Flash entirely, well eventually, Flash is still widely used but HTML5 is the beginning of the end and in time possibly even Javascript.</p>
                <p>Before going further, Javascript isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, HTML heavily relies on CSS and Javascript to make dynamic, functional and adaptive websites.  With that said, the future of the internet is to make it less bloated, load fast, adapt to any surface and eliminating elements helps achieve this goal.  There are many things that in the past required the use of Javascript for instance a shopping cart or a lovely slideshow to showcase your photos.  Javascript makes the website pop, be dynamic and animated.  With HTML5 and CSS3 you can create a fully functional animated slideshow or shopping cart without the use of Javascript.  HTML is more powerful than you thought, and widely regarded as the most underrated technical language since it is used every day by everyone who uses the internet.  Again Javascript isn’t going anywhere anytime soon however it is interesting to see where HTML5 takes us.</p>
                <p>HTML5 is a living language and is also a work in progress, we have just touched the surface and it is not fully standardized so it isn’t recommended to discount HTML4 just yet older browsers such as Internet Explorer 8 don’t support HTML5.   HTML5 has come out of the gate swinging some impressive changes to the way we build websites however its adoption will be slow just as any newly developed technology.  There is still a great number  of users that still use Microsoft Windows XP which is why backwards compatibility is so important to keep in mind when developing in any language.</p>
